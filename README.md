## Project Idea 1 : MediCALL
### Project Idea Description :
MediCALL automates the process of booking X - Ray appointments, Consultation Visits and Requirement for Over the Counter Drugs for public health issues. MediCALL can provide the services in the absence of Internet Connectivity or Tech savvy knowledge.
MediCALL is an IOT and cloud based system which receives the caller input in the form of robocall input and will provide the appropriate service i.e. appointment booking, consultation visit timing and OTC drugs information via text SMS to the caller.

### Goal ( Who are the users? ) :
Any user having a feature phone or a smartphone without internet connectivity will be able to access minimum health care services.

### Technology Stack :
IOT : Raspberry Pi, GSM Module, Audio Jack (3.5 mm) <br>
Cloud : Firebase (Database, Cloud function) <br>
Languages : Python

## Project Idea 2: - Traffic Governance System
### Project Idea Description: -
Traffic system shows a great scope of trade with the environment and is directly connected to it. Manual traffic systems are proving to be insufficient due to rapid urbanization. Central monitoring systems are facing scalability issues as they process increasing amounts of data received from hundreds of traffic cameras. Major traffic problems like congestion, safety, pollution (leading to various health issues) and increased need for mobility. A solution to most of them is the construction of newer and safer highways and additional lanes on existing ones, but it proves to be expensive and often not feasible. Cities are limited by space and construction cannot keep up with ever-growing demand. Hence a need for an improved system with a minimal manual interface is persisting. Smart traffic governance system uses Artificial Intelligence to determine the flow of traffic, automated enforcement and communication to change the face of the traffic scenarios in urban cities suffering from such traffic issues.
Traffic governance system will deal with the traffic on the crossroads with the help of cameras on the crossroads which will detect the congestion with the help of image processing and get the count of vehicles in the heavy lane. After detecting the heavy lane, the timer for that particular will increase and the other lanes timer will be balanced accordingly.

### Goal: 
The scope of this project is very vast; people travelling long distances will be benefited the most by this application as the travel time will be greatly reduced.
People travelling in the day to day life for work will also be benefited by reducing the waiting time on the signals. It will help to create fewer congestion on the crossroads and the heavy lane.

### Technology Stack:
Frontend: - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS <br>
Database: - Mysql <br>
Backend and Tools: - Python, OpenCV, Flask (Framework), MatplotLib

## Project Idea 3: Real or Not!! Disaster Tweets
### Project idea description: 
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. For example, sometimes people use words like “ABLAZE”, “SHAKING”, “FLOODED” metaphorically in day-to-day activities. These same words can also be used in disastrous events which would lead to misinterpretation of the actual event happening. 

### Goal: 
To predict whether the tweets with words describing unfortunate events literally represent those events at the location tagged in the tweet.

### Technology stack: 
Jupyter Notebook, Python libraries, Support Vector Machine
